Description: The objective of bump hunting is to find regions in the input (attribute/feature) space with relatively high (low) values for the target variable. The regions are described by simple rules of the type if: condition-1 and ... and condition-n then: estimated target value. Given the data (or a subset of the data), the goal is to produce a box B within which the target mean is as large as possible. There are many problems where finding such regions is of considerable practical interest.  Often these are problems where a decision maker can in a sense choose or select the values of the input variables so as to optimize the value of the target variable. In bump hunting it is customary to follow a so-called covering strategy. This means that the same box construction (rule induction) algorithm is appliedsequentially to subsets of the data.
